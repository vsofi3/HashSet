# HashSet


A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collections classes/types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set. We are interested in mutable sets, in which insertion and deletion of elements from the set are permitted.1The interface to a Set ADT is defined in section 1 below. You are to completely implement the constructor and the ADT methods. You have a choice of implementing the set using a linked list or a hash table. If you implement it using a linked list, the project will be worth at most 30 of the 50 points. If you implement it using a hash table, the project will be able to access all 50 points for the project.Note that you MAY NOT implement the Set ADT using any other ADT other than Iterator; in particular, you may not use a Map ADT to implement the Set ADT.
